A Tale of Two Pitchers: An Evening at Busch Stadium

Sweat dripped down foreheads and soaked through shirts at Busch Stadium, the evening heat suffocating like a bad dream you can't wake from. The crowd, strong, was a mass of restless bodies waiting for something to happen. And something did.
St. Louis Cardinals stood on the mound, cool as a poet in a bar. Six innings, six hits, no runs. He played his game with the precision of a man who knows what it means to struggle. Each pitch a knife through the humid air, cutting down batters like they were nothing but tall weeds.
Kansas City Royals was on the other side, a pitcher with stats that looked good on paper but told a different story in real life. Six innings, nine hits, three runs. The numbers might look respectable, but under the bright lights, every pitch seemed to weigh him down more. His ERA, a haunting 2.43, whispered the truthâ€”sometimes you're your own worst enemy.
